If django.views.generic.edit.FormView is a generic editing view for creating a form not based on a model, 
how does a form based on a model differ?  
How do you create, edit, and style a form based on a model, like our Joke creation form?



Model-based forms in Django are created using ModelForm, which automatically generates form fields based on a Django model. This is different from forms using FormView, where you define each form field manually.

To create a form based on a model, follow these steps:

-- Import forms and your model.
-- Create a class inheriting from forms.ModelForm.
-- Define an inner Meta class within it, specifying the model it corresponds to and optionally the fields to include or exclude.

Example:

	from django import forms
	from .models import Joke

	class JokeForm(forms.ModelForm):
		class Meta:
			model = Joke
			fields = ['content', 'author']  # Specify fields to include
		
You can style forms using Django's form rendering options or by customizing the HTML templates where you render the form. 
Django forms use classes that make them compatible with many CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap.
