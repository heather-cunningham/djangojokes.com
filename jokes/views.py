    ## We use reverse_lazy() here because the view is created before the URL configuration.
    ## So, if you try to use reverse(), you will likely get an error about a circular import. 
    ## The issue with using reverse() is the view needs the URLConf to have already been created, 
    # but the URLConf imports the view. So, it cannot be created until the view exists.

    ## When no template_name is defined for a ListView, Django infers a template_name as: 
    #### `<app_name>/<model>_list.html`
    ## ...Where <app_name> is the name of the app (i.e., jokes). 
    ## And, <model> is the lowercase name of the model.

    #### `jokes/joke_list.html`
